We met all of the project criteria (to the best of our knowledge). \

We have a page that lets users add actor and director information (created by both
of us). This accepts multiple user inputs and adds it to the database. We have
radio buttons to distinguish between actor and directors, and radio buttons to
distinguish between gender. Besides that, we accept user inputs and sanitize the 
before using the values that are passed in. 


We have a page that lets users add movie information (created by Jay). This page
accepts most of the parameters as direct text inputs besides the genre. The genre
is a bunch of checkboxes composed of the 19 different distinct genres that were
there in the database after loading. Having an input like this allows for multiple
simultaneous genres being added. This could potentially be a constraint, however,
if we need to add more than the 19 present (we followed the example site as well
though, so presumably this is fine).

We have a page that lets users add comments to movies (created by Jay). This shows
a list of all possible movies, a list of possible ratings that the users need to
pick from. The user can also enter their name and a comment. The comment is a 
textarea field, and accepts inputs of up to 500 characters. 

We have a page that lets users add actor to movie relations (created by both of us).
This page displays all possible actor names and movie names in dropdown menus,
and allows users to input the role of the actor in that movie and adds the relation
to the database. 

We have a page that lets users add director to movie relations (created by Jay). 
This page displays all possible movie and director names and allows users to add
associations by selecting the two names.

We have a page that shows actor information (created by Eric).

We have a page that lets users search (created by Eric).
